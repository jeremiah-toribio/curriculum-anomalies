## Project Description
### Analyzing and anomaly detection for Codeup Curriculum Data

**Overview:**\
Tasked with checking the codeup server activity log, we are analyzing historical data that will provide information relative to previous cohorts and potentially anomylous behavior. \
**Method**\
Would include exploratory data analysis, anomaly detection, time series analysis and other methods.\
**Takeaways**\
There has been potential suspicious activity be users taht have no defined information with exception to their IP and user ID which is defined by the server itself.\
It has been found that some courses have been heavily focused by particular cohorts more than others.\
**Skills:**\
Python, Pandas, EDA, Time Series Analysis(TSA)

## Project Goals
---
- Field questions for stakeholder and provide sufficient evidence
- Review data and record observations & trends, as well as report any anomylous activity

## Initial Thoughts
--- 
The curriculum data should be appropriately labeled, goal here is to make sure we can field the questions to stakeholder sufficiently so that they may be able to act accordingly.

## Planning
--- 
1. Acquire data from text file source
2. Properly clean up and label data accordingly\
3. Explore and analyze data for better insights and answers\

## Conclusions 
- Some courses have been used more than others, in particular Javascript I is heavily referenced by web development students, and for data science students it was the categorical portion
## Recommendation
- There has been recorded unidentified activity that could due to numerous reasons, investigate further to see if this could be bad actors
